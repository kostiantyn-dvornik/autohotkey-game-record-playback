This tool is a game input recorder and player. The tool allows you to record input sequences while playing a game and later replay them for testing or automation purposes. Work together with TensorFlow based image classification.

# Features
- Record your keystrokes and mouse movements while playing a game.
- Replay the recorded input sequences, simulating the original gameplay.
- Text based recorded input.
- Adopted for Skyrim record/playback that analyze screen and do state based logic.
- Neural Network image classification for camera horizon stabilization, stuck, fight, road detection

# Installation
- Python 3.10
- pip install tensorflow-cpu==2.10 tensorflow-directml-plugin opencv-python matplotlib
- DX12 support for GPU training and execution acceleration

# Getting Started
1. Put NN.txt in root of Skyrim. It contains console commands to set daytime, endless HP etc.
1. Run Skyrim in window mode 1440x810
1. Hit toggle and enter bat NN it will run scipt to have same conditions
1. Use non snow location
1. Run Bot.py
1. Hit Skyrim windows to make it active
1. Press enter to start autoplayback
